# Accenture Backend

This backend environment is created using Node js and Express Js. Here, I have followed the ``Repository / Service`` pattern.


# Installtion

#### Step 1
- Clone the repository  `` git clone https://github.com/ravanspell/Accenture-Backend.git``.
 ####  Step2
- Run `` npm i `` to install dependencies.
####  Step3
- Rename ``.env.example`` file to``.env``.
####  Step4
- Create a database called ``accenture`` in your MySQL server.

####  Step5
- Add your database configurations to the ``.env`` file correctly.
#### Step6
- Run `` npm run dev``


## Important

- You don't have to create tables in the database. When you run the application those tables will be created automatically.  
- The postman collection is also attached with the mail please refer to it.
